# bootdev-static-site-generator

*Repo for the [Boot-dev Static Site Generator project](https://www.boot.dev/learn/build-maze-solver-python)*

This is my attempt to making a simple static site generator using Python. This basically converts markdown files and images to a static website, much like [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

I used `unittest` for unit tests.

## Pre-requisites:
- You must have a Unix machine (Linux, MacOS)
- You must have Python (pref 3.11) and Poetry installed

## Setup
> 

Install dependencies with:
```poetry install```


## Usage
1. Put your markdown files in the `content` folder

2. Run the `main.sh` script

3. Go to `localhost:8080` in your browser to witness the magic âœ¨
